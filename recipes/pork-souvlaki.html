    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    
        <p>Seasoned bits of pork or lamb are allowed to season in a Mediterranean marinade for as long as you can stand it! Wonderful with rice and a cucumber and tomato salad. Serve with lemon slices and chopped parsley.</p>

        <p>So this recipe looks delicious and simple. The top is copied from the web, I am writing this as a filler.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1 1/2-inch cube</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil </li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine </li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves, broken into pieces, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place pork tenderloin cubes into a gallon-sized resealable bag.</li>
            <li>Stir olive oil, dry white wine, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour over pork in the bag and mix well.</li>
            <li>Let pork marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 day, up to 5 days.</li>
            <li>Remove pork cubes from marinade and thread onto metal skewers. Place bay leaf pieces between meat cubes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Arrange skewers on the preheated grill. Turn the kabobs and baste with marinade frequently for the first 10 minutes of cooking, then discard marinade. Cook about 5 minutes longer, until pork is cooked through and juices run clear.</li>
